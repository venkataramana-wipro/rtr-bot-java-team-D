# RTR Bot - Java

Welcome to the Robocode challenge! This repository is for each team to create their Robocode bot in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started, please rename the folder "YourBotName" with the chosen name of your bot and follow the file structure as demonstrated in `MyFirstBot` within `sample-bot` folder.

## File Structure

Your bot's folder should follow this structure:

```
YourBotName/
├── YourBotName.java
├── YourBotName.json
├── YourBotName.sh
├── YourBotName.cmd
└── README.md
```

### Structure of the bot

Within the YourBotName, you should have the following files:

- **YourBotName.java**: This is the main class file for your Robocode bot.
- **YourBotName.sh**: Bash file to run the bot. Just copy the sample file into your directory and correct with your filename.
- **YourBotName.cmd**: Script file to run the bot on Windows.
- **README.md**: A readme file where you might want to tell us about 
your bot.
- **YourBotName.json**: This describes your bot. These fields are required in the json document:
- name
- version
- authors

The remaining fields are all optional, but recommended.

Meaning of each field in the JSON file:

- `name`: is the display name of the bot.
- `version`: is the version of the bot, where SEMVER is the recommended format, but not a requirement.
- `authors`: is a list containing the (full) name of the bot author(s). The name could be a nickname or handle.
- `description`: is a brief description of the bot.
- `homepage`: is a link to a web page for the bot.
- `countryCodes`: is a list containing Alpha-2 country codes, representing the country of each author and/or bot.
platform: is the platform required for running the bot, e.g. Java 17 or .Net 6.0.
- `programmingLang`: is the programming language used for programming the bot, e.g. C# or Kotlin.

## Sample Bot

Refer to the `sample-bot` folder for an example of how to structure your bot's files.

Make sure to test your bot thoroughly before submitting it.
